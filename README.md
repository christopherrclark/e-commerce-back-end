# E-Commerce Back End

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to build the the back end of an e-commerce site by modifying the starter code we were given. This project includes using Sequelize, MySQL2, Express, and dotenv packages and testing using Insomnia. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, I also provided a link below to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. 

### Acceptance Criteria
* How to create the schema from the MySQL shell. 
* `mysql -u root -p`, 
* `use ecommerce_db`, 
* `source db/schema.sql`, 
* `quit`
* How to seed the database from the command line. 
* `npm run seed`
* How to start the application’s server. 
* `npm start`
* GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.
* GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia.
* POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags being tested in Insomnia.
